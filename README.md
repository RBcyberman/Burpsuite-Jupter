<h1>Simple SQL Injection Lab with BurpSuite/DVWA/Mutillidae</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This basic SQL Injection Lab, leveraging the capabilities of Burp Suite, DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), and Mutillidae, represents an educational toolkit for mastering the intricacies of web security, specifically focusing on SQL Injectionâ€”one of the most potent threats to web applications. Burp Suite, a comprehensive set of tools for web application security testing, acts as a critical intermediary, allowing users to intercept and manipulate communications between clients and servers, thereby identifying potential vulnerabilities. DVWA and Mutillidae, both intentionally vulnerable web applications, serve as practical arenas for cybersecurity training. They simulate a wide array of security weaknesses, including SQL Injection, offering a hands-on experience in a controlled, legal environment. This setup not only aids security professionals in honing their penetration testing skills but also assists educators and students in integrating practical cybersecurity exercises into their curricula.
<br />
<br />
The confluence of these tools within the lab environment is beneficial to the cybersecurity community. It provides an invaluable platform for gaining firsthand experience in detecting, exploiting, and mitigating SQL Injection vulnerabilities, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of web application security. Moreover, by encouraging the development of security testing skills through real-world scenarios, the lab prepares individuals to better protect digital assets against emerging threats. This holistic approach to cybersecurity education underscores the importance of practical knowledge in complementing theoretical learning, making it an essential practice for those aspiring to excel in the cybersecurity field.

2. **Ensure Connectivity:**
   - Verifying the connection between the Kali and Metasploitable machines by sending a ping to the Metasploitable IP from Kali. The ping went through successfully.

3. **DVWA Setup:**
   - Activating the DVWA on the Metasploitable machine by selecting the DVWA option, following navigation to the Metasploitable IP and login with:

     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `password`

4. **Proxy Setup in Browser:**
   - Activating the browser's proxy settings, switching from 'no proxy' to 'Manual proxy configuration'. Configuring `127.0.0.1` as the HTTP proxy and using port number `8080`.:

5. **BurpSuite Configuration:**
   - Launching BurpSuite and selecting the 'Temporary project' along with the 'default setting' option. Ensuring the 'Intercept is Off' within the Proxy tab.

<h2>SQL Injection Practice:</h2>


1. **Engage with SQL Injection (Blind) in DVWA:**
   - Input `1` in the User ID field.
      <img src="https://imgur.com/77JUqxJ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Pentest"/>
   - Turn on Intercept in BurpSuite before submitting.
   - Following the submission of the User ID on DVWA, BurpSuite generates raw data, from which the cookie value will be copied.

2. **Analysis and Further Steps:**
   - After turning off the intercept feature in BurpSuite, the displayed output shows ID: 1, First Name: admin, and Surname: admin.
     <img src="https://imgur.com/vyk7PaP.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Pentest"/>
      
   - Change browser proxy settings back to no proxy.
